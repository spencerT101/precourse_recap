This is a recap of the precourse work.

Today we revised common terminal command lines such as:

mv commands
rm commands
cd commands

Later we had a refresher on basic python fundamentals for example

str
integ
boolean

how to create to variables and constants. Use basic functions such as sum, + etc


for the remainder of the lesson we had a refresher on Git and GitHub, for example:

git init
git log
git status
git commit 
git clone
git push

The purpose of this home is to further reinforce the current learnings on command line, git & github.

I am just adding an extra line to test my set up is correct.
